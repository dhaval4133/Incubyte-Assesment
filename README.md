# Sweet Shop Management System

A simple Java Spring Boot web application for managing a sweet shop, following TDD and clean code practices.

## TDD Approach
This project was developed using Test-Driven Development (TDD):
- For each feature, a failing test was written first (Red phase).
- The minimum code to pass the test was implemented (Green phase).
- Code was then refactored for clarity, maintainability, and SOLID principles (Refactor phase).
- This cycle was repeated for all core features: add, delete, search, sort, purchase, and restock.
- Each step is reflected in the commit history for transparency and traceability.
